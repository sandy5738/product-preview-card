## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I started this project with mobile first approach and learnt about HTML roles along with CSS flexbox and CSS Grid.

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to learn more about ARIA roles.

### Useful resources

- [MDN-ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) - This helped me to get a detailed understanding of ARIA. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
